# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy

All content MUST be technically accurate and verifiable. Every factual claim, code example, and technical explanation MUST be cross-checked against authoritative sources before inclusion.

- **Rationale**: Technical books establish trust through correctness; errors undermine credibility and reader learning outcomes.
- All code snippets MUST be tested or validated for correctness before inclusion.
- No unverified claims or speculative statements presented as fact.
- When uncertainty exists, it MUST be explicitly acknowledged.

### II. Clarity and Structure

Content MUST be clear, well-structured, and suitable for intermediate-to-advanced learners in software engineering and AI.

- **Rationale**: Target audience has foundational knowledge; explanations should build on that without over-simplifying or assuming expert-level familiarity.
- Writing clarity target: Flesch-Kincaid grade level 8-12 (technical clarity prioritized over simplicity).
- Each concept MUST be introduced before being referenced.
- Complex topics MUST be broken into digestible subsections with clear headings.

### III. Consistency

Writing style, terminology, and formatting MUST remain consistent across the entire book.

- **Rationale**: Inconsistency creates cognitive overhead and reduces professional quality perception.
- Terminology MUST be defined once and used uniformly throughout.
- Formatting conventions (code blocks, callouts, emphasis) MUST follow a documented style guide.
- Citation format MUST be consistent (MLA or APA) throughout all chapters.

### IV. Modularity

Each chapter and section MUST be self-contained yet internally connected to the overall narrative.

- **Rationale**: Readers may access chapters non-linearly; each section should deliver value independently while supporting the complete work.
- Chapters MUST have clear learning objectives stated upfront.
- Cross-references between chapters MUST use explicit links, not assumptions.
- Book length: 8-12 chapters, each 800-2000 words.

### V. Tool-Guided Authorship

All content generation and refinement MUST follow Spec-Kit Plus standards and the defined workflow.

- **Rationale**: Consistent tooling ensures reproducibility, traceability, and quality control throughout the authoring process.
- Specifications, plans, and tasks MUST be created before implementation.
- PHRs (Prompt History Records) MUST document all AI-assisted authoring sessions.
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) MUST document significant content or structural decisions.

### VI. Source Verification

All factual information MUST be verified through reliable, up-to-date sources with proper attribution.

- **Rationale**: Attribution enables reader verification and respects intellectual property rights.
- Source hierarchy: Official documentation > Standards/RFCs > Reputable technical blogs > Academic papers.
- No copyrighted content copied verbatim unless explicitly permitted (rewrite or attribute appropriately).
- All images MUST be either AI-generated by the toolchain or self-created (no copyrighted diagrams).

## Content Standards

This section defines the technical requirements for all book content.

### Output Format Requirements

- All content MUST be in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`).
- Directory and file structure MUST follow Docusaurus best practices.
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages via Docusaurus build pipeline.

### Book Structure Requirements

Final book MUST include at minimum:
- 1 introduction chapter establishing context and learning path
- 1 architecture or system-design chapter covering tool ecosystem
- 3+ chapters demonstrating AI-driven software workflows
- 1 appendix for tools, setup, and references

### Code Example Requirements

- All code examples MUST be syntactically correct and runnable.
- Examples MUST include necessary imports/dependencies.
- Non-trivial examples MUST include comments explaining key logic.
- Language and framework versions MUST be explicitly stated.

## Development Workflow

This section defines the process for creating and maintaining book content.

### Content Creation Process

1. **Specification**: Define chapter objectives and acceptance criteria via `/sp.specify`.
2. **Planning**: Create implementation plan with structure decisions via `/sp.plan`.
3. **Task Generation**: Break chapter into discrete, testable tasks via `/sp.tasks`.
4. **Implementation**: Execute tasks following Red-Green-Refactor where applicable.
5. **Review**: Validate content against success criteria and constitution principles.

### Quality Gates

Before any chapter is considered complete:
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified against primary sources
- [ ] Code examples tested and validated
- [ ] Writing clarity meets Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-12 target
- [ ] Terminology consistent with glossary/previous chapters
- [ ] Docusaurus build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] Cross-references validated

### Version Control

- All content changes tracked in Git.
- Commits MUST reference relevant specs/tasks.
- PRs required for chapter completion milestones.

## Governance

This constitution establishes the authoritative standards for the AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation project. All contributors (human and AI) MUST adhere to these principles.

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with rationale.
2. Changes to Core Principles require explicit approval.
3. All amendments MUST update the version number per semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Principle removals or incompatible redefinitions
   - **MINOR**: New principles or material expansions
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording, non-semantic refinements
4. Amendment date MUST be recorded.

### Compliance

- All PRs and reviews MUST verify compliance with constitution principles.
- Deviations require documented justification in complexity tracking.
- PHRs provide audit trail for AI-assisted decisions.

### Runtime Guidance

For day-to-day development guidance, refer to:
- `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific instructions
- `.specify/` templates for workflow patterns
- `history/adr/` for recorded architectural decisions
