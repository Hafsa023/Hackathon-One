## Prompt

/sp.constitution

Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code

Core Principles:
- Technical accuracy and correctness across all chapters
- Clear, structured explanations suitable for intermediate-to-advanced learners in software engineering and AI
- Consistency in writing style, terminology, and formatting across the entire book
- Modularity: each section should be self-contained but internally connected
- Tool-guided authorship: all content generated or refined must follow Spec-Kit Plus standards

Key Standards:
- All factual information must be verified through reliable, up-to-date sources
- Citation format: MLA or APA (maintain consistency throughout the book)
- Source types: documentation-first (official docs, standards, RFCs), reputable technical blogs, academic papers when required
- All code snippets must be tested or validated for correctness before inclusion
- No copyrighted content copied verbatim unless permitted (rewrite unless licensed)
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8–12 (technical clarity prioritized over simplicity)
- Directory and file structure must follow Docusaurus best practices

Constraints:
- Final book length: 8–12 chapters, each 800–2000 words
- Must include at least:
  - 1 introduction chapter
  - 1 architecture or system-design chapter
  - 3+ chapters demonstrating AI-driven software workflows
  - 1 appendix for tools, setup, and references
- Output format: Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`)
- Deployment target: GitHub Pages via Docusaurus build pipeline
- All images must be either AI-generated by the toolchain or self-created (no copyrighted diagrams)

Success Criteria:
- Book builds successfully in Docusaurus with no formatting or build errors
- GitHub Pages deployment passes without warnings
- All chapters are internally consistent in style and terminology
- All claims, definitions, or facts cross-checked against sources
- Code examples run successfully or reflect best practices
- Clear instructional flow suitable for readers following along with Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code

## Response snapshot

Created initial constitution v1.0.0 for the AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation project. The constitution establishes:

**6 Core Principles:**
1. Technical Accuracy - All content must be verified and cross-checked
2. Clarity and Structure - Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-12 target for intermediate-to-advanced learners
3. Consistency - Uniform style, terminology, and formatting throughout
4. Modularity - Self-contained chapters with explicit cross-references
5. Tool-Guided Authorship - Spec-Kit Plus workflow mandatory (specs, plans, tasks, PHRs, ADRs)
6. Source Verification - Documentation-first source hierarchy with proper attribution

**Content Standards Section:**
- Docusaurus-compatible Markdown output format
- Book structure requirements (8-12 chapters, specific chapter types)
- Code example requirements (tested, imports included, versions stated)

**Development Workflow Section:**
- 5-step content creation process (specify, plan, tasks, implement, review)
- Quality gates checklist for chapter completion
- Version control requirements

**Governance Section:**
- Amendment process with semantic versioning
- Compliance requirements
- Runtime guidance references

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution created establishing authoritative standards for book project
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (created v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify for first chapter, create project README
- 🧠 Reflection: User input was comprehensive; 6 principles extracted naturally from the requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - user input was well-structured
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if 6 principles are too many for practical compliance checking
